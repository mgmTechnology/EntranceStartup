Problem

There is a readable (=unencrypted, access rights are given) JSON file in the file system of the robot,
the file is located in the internal storage of the application.

a) this file is to be read in
b) parsed and converted into a processable object
c) transfer it to QiChat so that it can be read by the robot as a dialog.

to a) the file is located in the root directory of the app and is called dialog.json
to b) the structure of the file is a list of objects containing speech inputs and outputs.

Example:

[
  {
    "input": "Hallo Pepper!",
    "output": "Hallo Mensch!"
  },
  {
    "input": "Wie alt bist Du?",
    "output": "Ich bin 4 Jahre."
  }
]

to c) qiChat is a text based format, the rules are as follows:

* Each qiChat file starts with a naming of the topic, everything in capital letters must be named/filled accordingly by
yourself.

topic: ~NAME()

This is followed by the input/output rules of the dialog, in the following form:
u:(INPUT) OUTPUT
